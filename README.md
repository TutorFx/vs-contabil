## ✨ Features

#### 🧩 Service Pattern

The service pattern was used to organize the business logic of the application. This pattern helps to keep the code clean and easy to maintain, clearly separating responsibilities.

#### 🌐 Google APIs

Google APIs were used to integrate the application with Google Sheets. This allows data to be sent directly to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, making it easy to manage and analyze data.

#### 🔍 @nuxtseo/module

The @nuxtseo/module module was used to generate metadata that makes the application easier to index by search engines.

#### 🎨 Tailwind CSS

The entire application is built using Tailwind CSS, a low-level CSS framework that allows for the easy creation of custom designs. This makes the application incredibly fast and lightweight.

#### 📏 Eslint

The application uses ESLint with specific plugins to work together with Tailwind and Vue. This helps to maintain code quality and prevent common errors.

#### ⚡ nuxt-speedkit and @nuxt/image

nuxt-speedkit and @nuxt/image were used to speed up page performance. These tools help to optimize image loading and the overall performance of the application.

#### 🎉 nuxt-icon

Nuxt-icon was used for the icons. This allows for the use of a wide variety of icons easily and efficiently.

## 🎯 Final considerations

This architecture allows for a clear separation of responsibilities and facilitates the maintenance and expansion of the application in the future. Additionally, the integration with Google Sheets offers a convenient and efficient way to manage user data.
